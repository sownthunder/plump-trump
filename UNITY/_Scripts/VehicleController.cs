/**
 * A simple car physics script using wheel colliders.
 * Jaap Kreijkamp [jaap] at [ctrl-j.com.au]
 *
 * orientation should be that front of car is in direction of
 * the 'blue arrow' in Unity, the roof should be in direction of
 * the green angle. Thus with rotation 0, 0, 0, adding 1 to Z
 * will move car 1m forward, adding 1 to Y will move car 1m
 * upward. The wheels should be children of the car object this
 * script is added to and connected to the wheelFL, wheelFR, ...
 * variables.
 *
 * Please modify script and do whatever you like with it,
 * in it's current state it should give a working car,
 * but by no means perfect (or even close) behavior.
 * It's my first attempt and don't really need in my current
 * project so haven't put too much effort into it to perfect
 * it. As often people are looking for help to getting
 * a car working with wheel colliders, I'd appreciate when
 * improvements are posted back on the unity forums.
 *
 * Lastly, thanks to all the people helping me on forums (especially
 * the order of initialisation problem and other example
 * code that helped me much in learning how to do stuff like
 * this).
